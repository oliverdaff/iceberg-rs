/*!
Details of [snapshots](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#snapshots) for a table.

A [SnapshotV2] contains a pointer to the ManifestList as well as supporting data for the Snapshot.

A [Reference] is a named pointer to a [SnapshotV2] stored in the [refs field of the TableMetadataV2](crate::model::table::TableMetadataV2#structfield.refs).
a [Reference] can be a [Tag](Retention#variant.Tag) or [Branch](Retention#variant.Branch).
